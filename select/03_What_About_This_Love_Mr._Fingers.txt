What about this love?
Girl please don't turn your back on me.
What about our promise to each other?
Our touch and that we would not leave.
It seems is was all in vain cause now all i have is pain.
Thinking why i've tried so hard.
And now you just disregard what we ever had.
What about my kisses?
Did they mean anything to you?
What about this long nights together?
Did you just had nothing else to do?
It seems it was all i have is pain.
Thinking why i've tried so hard.
And now you just disregard what we ever had.
What about this love?
