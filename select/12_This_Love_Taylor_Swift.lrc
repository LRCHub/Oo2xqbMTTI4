[00:27.55] Clear blue water
[00:30.65] High tide came and brought you in
[00:35.42] And I could go on and on, on and on
[00:39.75] And I will, skies grow darker, currents swept you out again
[00:48.76] And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
[00:53.68] In silent screams and wildest dreams
[00:59.89] I never dreamed of this
[01:06.88] This love is good
[01:08.38] This love is bad
[01:10.11] This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh
[01:14.45] These hands had to let it go free
[01:16.86] And this love came back to me, oh-oh
[01:23.36] Oh, oh-oh
[01:34.13] Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
[01:42.16] And I could go on and on, on and on
[01:47.46] Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind, only you
[01:55.35] But you were still gone, gone, gone
[01:59.91] Been losing grip, on sinking ships
[02:06.36] You showed up just in time
[02:13.74] This love is good
[02:15.25] This love is bad
[02:16.65] This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh
[02:20.97] These hands had to let it go free
[02:23.36] And this love came back to me, oh-oh
[02:27.42] This love left a permanent mark
[02:30.03] This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh
[02:34.12] These hands had to let it go free
[02:36.87] And this love came back to me, oh-oh
[02:40.33] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[02:44.05] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[02:47.44] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[02:50.48] This love, this love, this love, this love
[02:54.77] Your kiss, my cheek
[02:57.89] I watched you leave
[03:01.14] Your smile, my ghost
[03:04.49] I fell to my knees
[03:07.76] When you're young you just run
[03:10.76] But you come back to what you need
[03:20.51] This love is good
[03:22.15] This love is bad
[03:23.67] This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh
[03:27.65] These hands had to let it go free
[03:30.26] And this love came back to me, oh-oh
[03:34.00] (This love) This love that's a permanent mark
[03:36.95] (This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh
[03:40.86] (This love) These hands had to let it go free
[03:43.87] (This love) And this love came back to me, oh-oh
[03:47.00] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[03:50.65] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[03:53.88] This love, this love, this love, this love (oh)
[03:56.90] This love, this love, this love, this love (this love came back to me, oh-oh)
