[00:20.33] I was so high, I did not recognize
[00:23.98] The fire burning in her eyes
[00:26.56] The chaos that controlled my mind
[00:30.52] Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
[00:34.17] Never to return again but always in my heart, oh
[00:58.17] 
[00:41.02] This love has taken its toll on me
[00:45.36] She said goodbye too many times before
[00:50.90] And her heart is breakin' in front of me
[00:55.47] And I have no choice
[00:57.73] 'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[01:14.73] 
[01:02.36] Whoa
[01:04.66] Whoa
[01:07.21] Whoa
[01:09.21] 
[01:11.19] I tried my best to feed her appetite
[01:14.53] Keep her coming every night
[01:16.93] So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
[01:20.87] Kept playing love like it was just a game
[01:24.32] Pretending to feel the same
[01:26.93] Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh
[01:48.43] 
[01:31.54] This love has taken its toll on me
[01:35.83] She said goodbye too many times before
[01:41.49] And her heart is breakin' in front of me
[01:45.99] And I have no choice
[01:48.29] 'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[02:05.29] 
[01:52.86] Whoa
[01:55.36] Whoa
[01:57.73] Whoa
[01:59.73] 
[02:01.14] I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
[02:06.44] And make sure everything's all right (it's all right, it's all right)
[02:11.52] My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips
[02:16.47] Every inch of you
[02:18.28] Because I know that's what you want me to do
[02:40.28] 
[02:22.10] This love has taken its toll on me
[02:26.34] She said goodbye too many times before
[02:32.10] Her heart is breakin' in front of me
[02:36.57] And I have no choice
[02:38.66] 'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[02:55.66] 
[02:42.37] This love has taken its toll on me
[02:46.77] She said goodbye too many times before
[02:52.13] And my heart is breakin' in front of me
[02:56.50] And she said goodbye too many times before
[03:17.50] 
[03:02.63] This love has taken its toll on me
[03:06.90] She said goodbye too many times before
[03:12.32] And her heart is breakin' in front of me
[03:16.93] And I have no choice
[03:18.94] 'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
