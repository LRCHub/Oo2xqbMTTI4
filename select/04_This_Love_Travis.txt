Up above the town below
Waiting for the lights to show
Safe and sound
Wrong the right way round

Come on
This love's killing
My heart's healing (?)
Telling me to stay
This love better
Last forever
In a voodoo way

Everybody's growin' up
Makin' kids
And breakin' up
Save me now
Burn the sacred cow

Come on
This love's killing
My heart's healing (?)
Telling me to stay
This love better
Last forever
In a voodoo way

Brace yourself
We're going down
Tell me when
We hit the ground
Safe and sound
Wrong the right way round

Come on
This love's killing
My heart's healing (?)
Telling me to stay
This love better
Last forever
In a voodoo way

This love's killing
My heart's healing (?)
Telling me to stay
This love better
Last forever
In a voodoo way

(12x)This love
Lalalalalalalalala

This love
